                                                    Foreign exchange or Forex is the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another. Currencies are traded through a broker or dealer and are executed in currency pairs. For example: the Euro and the US Dollar (EUR/USD) or the British Pound and
                                                    the Japanese Yen (GBP/JPY). The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex) is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily volume of over $4 trillion. This is more than three times the total amount of
                                                    the stocks and futures markets combined. Unlike other financial markets, the Forex spot market has neither a physical location nor a central exchange. It operates through an electronic network of banks,
                                                    corporations, and individuals trading one currency for another. The lack of a physical exchange enables the Forex market to operate on a 24-hour basis, spanning from one time zone to another across the
                                                    major financial centers. This fact – that there is no centralized exchange – is important to keep in mind as it permeates all aspects of the Forex experience.

                                                    Margin is a part of a commodity traders life. In simple terms, margin means borrowing money from the broker to take a position in the derivatives market. Commodity futures are highly leveraged instruments, where traders can enter the market by paying
                                                    only a fraction of total trade volume. For example, gold futures require a margin of 4 percent, which means one can trade up to a volume of Rs 1 crore by paying only a margin on Rs 4 lakhs.

                                                    The main idea behind a debt consolidation loan is that it gives you logistical benefits, rather than actually saving you money, as you still have to pay back the same amount. You can apply for a loan whose repayment term is longer than those you are currently
                                                    tied to, allowing you to spend less each month but, given the extended term and the interest added, you may actually end up paying back more money overall.

                                                    Mutual Funds, historically, have proven to be much better investment avenues than other products available to investors. Investments in MF have proven to be more effective because of the following reasons:
                                                    <br><br>• Managed by professionals: Financial experts invest in equity and fixed income products invest on your behalf. They are supported by large teams which assist them in analyzing data and dissecting
                                                    nitty gritty of the markets(macro and micro economic environment, GDP rates, Interest rates and its future outlook, fundamental analysis into each company that they invest or not invest in) which clients
                                                    as individuals might not be able to do themselves.
                                                    <br><br>• Better taxation structures: The government of India offers incentives to customers to invest in mutual funds by providing tax structures. So while your fixed deposit returns are completely
                                                    taxable, Investment in debt mutual funds come with tax indexation benefits (which can lower your taxation burden to almost as low as 2% as opposed to as high as 30% in Fixed deposits). Investments in
                                                    equity mutual funds have only 10% tax (on gains withdrawn above ₹1 lakh in an year) compared to 30% taxation on FDs. Gains on equity mutual funds withdrawn up to ₹1 lakh in an year are exempt from tax.
                                                    <br><br>• Better Flexibility: Mutual funds are held in units. So you can always redeem your investment partially while keeping the other investment intact and untouched. This is unlike fixed deposits
                                                    where you have to fully withdraw your investment and pay pre-mature withdrawal charges on the entire amount.
                                                    <br><br>• Better liquidity: Open ended mutual funds can be sold anytime. This is unlike investment like Insurance, PPF, NSC, etc. where you have long lock-in periods and large pre-mature withdrawal penalties.
                                                    <br><br>• Better Diversification: Mutual funds invest in multiple securities. This diversifies the risk for you much better than other investments.
